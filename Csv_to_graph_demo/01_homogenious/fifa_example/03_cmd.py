"""
pd.read_csv is a function in the Python pandas library used for reading data from a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file and creating a DataFrame object. A CSV file is a plain text file that represents tabular data where each row is a record and each column is a field.

    pd.read_csv takes in the path of the CSV file as its argument and returns a DataFrame object. This function can read a variety of CSV file formats, such as files with different separators (e.g., tab-separated values), files with a header row, files with missing data, and files with different encoding formats.

    Here is an example of how to use pd.read_csv to read a CSV file:

    python
    Copy code
    import pandas as pd

    # Read a CSV file
    df = pd.read_csv('filename.csv')

    # Print the first 5 rows of the DataFrame
    print(df.head())
    This will read the file 'filename.csv' and create a DataFrame object that can be used for data analysis, manipulation, and visualization.

"""
selects a subset of columns from a pandas DataFrame called player_df.

player_df = player_df[["int_player_id", "str_player_name", "str_positions", "int_overall_rating", "int_team_id"]]
The resulting DataFrame will only include the columns specified in the list, in the order they are listed. The new DataFrame will have the same rows as the original DataFrame, but with only the selected columns. The original player_df DataFrame is overwritten by the new DataFrame with the selected columns.

int_player_id: The unique identifier for the player.
str_player_name: The name of the player.
str_positions: The player's positions.
int_overall_rating: The player's overall rating.
int_team_id: The unique identifier for the team that the player is on.
